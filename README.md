# TicTacToe-SmartBot-or-PvP

This is my personal Python and GUI learning project — a classic Tic Tac Toe game featuring two modes:  
- Player vs Player — play locally with a friend  
- Player vs Smart Bot — an AI opponent with basic logic to find winning positions

Built with Python and Tkinter to practice programming and GUI design.  
The bot uses simple strategies to detect potential wins, making the gameplay more challenging than a random move generator.

## Features

- Graphical interface using Tkinter  
- Two game modes: PvP and PvC  
- Smart bot with basic winning strategy  
- Reset functionality  
- Simple and clean design  

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. No additional packages required.

## Usage

Run the `main.py` file to open the main menu and select the desired mode.
